Title:    Interrupt UART library with receive/transmit circular buffers
Author:   Peter Fleury <pfleury@gmx.ch>   http://jump.to/fleury
File:     $Id: uart.c,v 1.6.2.1 2007/07/01 11:14:38 peter Exp $
Software: AVR-GCC 4.1, AVR Libc 1.4.6 or higher
Hardware: any AVR with built-in UART, 
License:  GNU General Public License 
          
DESCRIPTION:
    An interrupt is generated when the UART has finished transmitting or
    receiving a byte. The interrupt handling routines use circular buffers
    for buffering received and transmitted data.
    
    The UART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE and UART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE variables define
    the buffer size in bytes. Note that these variables must be a 
    power of 2.
    
USAGE:
    Refere to the header file uart.h for a description of the routines. 
    See also example test_uart.c.

    Based on Atmel Application Note AVR306

Changelog for modifications made by Tim Sharpe, starting with the current
  library version on his Web site as of 05/01/2009. 

Date        Description
=========================================================================
05/11/2009  Changed all existing UARTx_RECEIVE_INTERRUPT and UARTx_TRANSMIT_INTERRUPT
              macros to use the "_vect" format introduced in AVR-Libc
			  v1.4.0.  Had to split the 3290 and 6490 out of their existing
			  macro due to an inconsistency in the UART0_RECEIVE_INTERRUPT 
			  vector name (seems like a typo: USART_RX_vect for the 3290/6490
			  vice USART0_RX_vect for the others in the macro).
			Verified all existing macro register names against the device
			  header files in AVR-Libc v1.6.6 to catch any inconsistencies.
05/12/2009  Added support for 48P, 88P, 168P, and 328P by adding them to the
               existing 48/88/168 macro.
			Added Arduino-style available() and flush() functions for both
			supported UARTs.  Really wanted to keep them out of the library, so
			that it would be as close as possible to Peter Fleury's original
			library, but has scoping issues accessing internal variables from
			another program.  Go C!
05/13/2009  Changed Interrupt Service Routine label from the old "SIGNAL" to
               the "ISR" format introduced in AVR-Libc v1.4.0.
